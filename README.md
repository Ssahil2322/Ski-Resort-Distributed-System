# Ski-Resort-Distributed-System

1)Developed a distributed system using Java, Oracle Cloud, Tomcat/Jetty server, Swaggerhub, Java 11 HTTP client, 
Apache Java HTTP API, and POSTMAN to digitalize the ski industry by collecting and analyzing lift ride data from 
multiple resorts.

2)Built a client to generate and send lift ride data to a server hosted on Oracle Cloud using Java 11 HTTP client 
classes, the Apache Java HTTP API, and implemented the POST API for the /skiers endpoint using Java servlets, 
validating parameters and returning 4XX/200/201 HTTP responses as per the specification. 

3)Designed a multithreaded Java client that uploads 10K POST requests to the server using 32 threads that each 
send 1000 POST requests and terminate. 

4)Implemented a mechanism to handle errors by retrying requests up to five times if the client receives a 5XX/4XX 
HTTP response code, and optimized the system to achieve maximum throughput, calculated using Little's Law. 

5)Demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, distributed systems, multithreading, API development, and 
performance optimization.
